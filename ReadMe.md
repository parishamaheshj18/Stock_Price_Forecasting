# GRU and LSTM Model Comparison

This project provides an in-depth comparison of **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** models, two popular types of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) used in time series forecasting and sequence modeling tasks. The project explores the architecture, implementation, and performance of both models in forecasting or classifying sequential data.

## Project Overview
Recurrent neural networks like GRU and LSTM are well-suited to handling sequence data, making them popular choices for tasks such as time series forecasting, language modeling, and natural language processing. This project aims to:
- Implement GRU and LSTM models using **Python** and **TensorFlow/Keras**.
- Compare the two models based on performance metrics such as accuracy, loss, and computational efficiency.
- Provide insights into the suitability of each model for various time series tasks.

The notebook includes code for data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

## Requirements
- **Python** 3.x
- **TensorFlow** >= 2.x
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib** (for plotting)
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)

To install the necessary libraries, you can use the following command:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib pandas
```
## Installation


1) Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/parishamaheshj18/Stock_Price_Forecasting.git
```
2) Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Stock_Price_Forecasting
```

Install the required packages listed in the Requirements section if you haven't already.

## Usage

To explore the project and run the models:

Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook GRU_LSTM.ipynb
```

- Follow along with the notebook to:
- Preprocess your data.
- Train both GRU and LSTM models.
- Evaluate and compare model performance.

```
## Results

The notebook provides a detailed comparison between GRU and LSTM models, evaluating each based on:

- Model accuracy and loss metrics over training and validation datasets.
- Computational efficiency (e.g., training time and memory usage).
- Visualizations of model performance to aid in interpreting the results.
- The results section in the notebook also includes a discussion on when to prefer one model over the other based on the data characteristics and application requirements.
