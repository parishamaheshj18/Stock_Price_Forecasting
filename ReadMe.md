# GRU and LSTM Model Comparison

This project provides an in-depth comparison of **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** models, two popular types of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) used in time series forecasting and sequence modeling tasks. The project explores the architecture, implementation, and performance of both models in forecasting or classifying sequential data.

## Project Overview
Recurrent neural networks like GRU and LSTM are well-suited to handling sequence data, making them popular choices for tasks such as time series forecasting, language modeling, and natural language processing. This project aims to:
- Implement GRU and LSTM models using **Python** and **TensorFlow/Keras**.
- Compare the two models based on performance metrics such as accuracy, loss, and computational efficiency.
- Provide insights into the suitability of each model for various time series tasks.

The notebook includes code for data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

## Requirements
- **Python** 3.x
- **TensorFlow** >= 2.x
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib** (for plotting)
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)

To install the necessary libraries, you can use the following command:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib pandas
